# T's Virtual Kitchen

A website that lets users browse, filter and interact with recipes, using a simple account system. Once logged in, users can add and edit recipes.

Built using laravel with the php framework for server-side, with MySQL for the database (not included here), and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for client-side.

## Lessons Learned

- how the hell laravel works
- how to actually implement a MVC (model/view/controller) system
- how the hell blade works
- (sort of) how the hell laravel breeze works (WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE)
- pain.
